<p>This book started slowly and I almost didn’t finish it. I started another one and came back to it and ended up enjoying it. The main character is less than likable but Azure and his Associative were far more interesting, particular their abilities.</p>

<p>Another great summer read. I found the author through a visit to the University of Chicago’s Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures. The author was actually Barbara Mertz, a UChicago doctorate grad with extensive knowledge in Egyptology and who was involved extensively with the Institute. Here’s a <a href="https://isac.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/shared/docs/ar/11-20/12-13/12-13_Memoriam_Mertz.pdf">bio</a> of her interesting life.</p>

			 <p>★★★☆☆ <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780141350394">The Red Pyramid</a> by Rick Riordan 📚</p>
<p>I wanted a fast read to kickstart my 2025 reading and figured this would be a good option as it recently came recommended to me by two younger friends of mine. I read two other series of his, but hadn’t gotten around to this one yet. Overall, I’d say it was just fine. It was extremely predictable having read his other works. But I did enjoy the family aspect of the story. And it did spark some interest in Egyptian mythology.</p>

<p>The cross is a word that is not shallow, sentimental or merely edifying. This was [the Apostle] Paul’s deepest conviction: the knowledge that he was loved. [It] only made sense to him because he knew that something even greater lay behind it: the fact that “he loved me”. (46)</p>

			 <p>From Dilexit Nos. The heart is necessary for human bonding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A society dominated by narcissism and self-centredness will increasingly become “heartless”. This will lead in turn to the “loss of desire”, since as other persons disappear from the horizon we find ourselves trapped within walls of our own making, no longer capable of healthy relationships.&rdquo; (17)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We see, then, that in the heart of each person there is a mysterious connection between self-knowledge and openness to others, between the encounter with one’s personal uniqueness and the willingness to give oneself to others. (18)</p>

			 <p>★★★★★ <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780385550376">James</a> by Percival Everett 📚</p>
<p>I haven’t started and finished a book in a single day in a very long time. A memorable read, fast paced, and eye opening, even if it’s a fiction story. Everett is a master and I’m seriously disappointed in myself that I’m just now learning about him.</p>

			 <p>This is just a little nerdy post mostly so I don&rsquo;t ever forget how to do this again. I needed to be able to fade in and out content coming from ProPresenter on an ATEM Constellation 2ME switcher. This is so that we can show/hide things like lyrics, titles, etc., but also do it in a way that looks nice. This requires a transition, but by default the preview source is included in a transition. So if you have a camera shot lined up and have selected a camera, hitting Auto Transition will also change your program source to the preview source. This is not good.</p>
<p>This configuration is easy to achieve in the ATEM Software Control app, by just removing &ldquo;background&rdquo; from the next transition and making sure that the whatever key source has the ProPresenter content is enabled for the next transition. But it&rsquo;s a pain to have to use the mouse and go to that app, especially if you have a single computer and one person switching and another using the computer to run ProPresenter.</p>
<p>The main problem was that I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to do this using a Stream Deck button. So, as usual, the <a href="https://bitfocus.io/companion">Companion app</a> fixes this problem. At first I tried to make a button that uses the &ldquo;atem: Transition: Change selection component&rdquo; action, since it looks like it would work:</p>
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/27737/2024/screenshotjump-desktop2024-07-14-at-20.54.512x.png" width="600" height="511" alt="">
<p>But that didn&rsquo;t work at all. What DID work was using &ldquo;atem: Transition: Change selection&rdquo; button.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/27737/2024/screenshotjump-desktop2024-07-14-at-20.37.572x.png" width="600" height="465" alt="">
<p>Removing &ldquo;Background&rdquo; in the Selection box, and adding my upstream key did the trick here. Then I added a Feedbacks using &ldquo;atem: Upstream key: OnAir state&rdquo; so that the button lights up when the upstream key is turned on. It works great and I now have an easy button to easily, but nicely, show/hide the upstream content from ProPresenter on our livestream.</p>

<p>The problem is that many people specifically use Firefox because they’re sick of advertising and cross-promotion everywhere and want a browser that’s “just a browser”. </p>

<p>This isn’t the right answer for everyone, but it’s why I use Safari as much as I can.</p>

<p>It is easy to forget, the Pope said, that “strictly speaking, so-called generative artificial intelligence is not really ‘generative’” – it does not “develop new analyses or concepts” but rather “repeats those that it finds, giving them an appealing form.”</p>

			 <p>★★★★☆ Star Trek: Discovery</p>
<p>Just finished the series finale. I’ll just say off the bat: I loved this show. I love everything the Federation represents and this particular show embodied the best parts of it.</p>
<p>There was a line in the finale where (spoilers here)….Captain Burnham said she’d seen the events that transpired over billions of years that resulted in her existence, standing exactly where she stood. It really struck me in that moment that this is the reason the Federation captivates me. Yes I love the idea of exploring the universe, and meeting aliens, and all of the cool “tech”, but the Federation ultimately exists to ensure peace, prosperity, and connectedness for all.</p>
<p>The other day I asked the family during dinner what fictional universe you’d love to live in, and my answer was of course Star Trek, and this show was part of the reason why. It has its detractors and it’s not perfect by any means, but I love the “Starfleet as family” motif and this show fully embodied that.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I recently moved a worship team I am on from Slack to Discord as our primary team communication platform. Why?</p>
<ol>
<li>Slack&rsquo;s free plan had too many restrictions on search and organization</li>
<li>Slack&rsquo;s paid plans are too expensive for our team</li>
<li>Discord offers most of what Slack does for free, with the ability to make meaningful upgrades via server boosts</li>
</ol>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t have been so surprised at how well the team took the change, given that most of the team is under 25. One team member said &ldquo;finally!&rdquo;. So far we love how fun it is and how easy it is to engage with the team. There are some features I miss from Slack, like the Activity tab, attachment previews, and the WYSIWYG text editor.  But the search is fine, I love the roles and te ability to customize channels and categories with permissions, and notifications are very reliable. We plan on using voice channels for group listening and prayer, as we&rsquo;ve already used them for ad-hoc meetings and screen sharing.</p>
<p>I know that Discord has said they are moving back to their core strength of helping gamers connect, but there are some large non-gaming communities on Discord and I&rsquo;m not so worried that they will drop features we use.</p>

			 <p>I did a little thing yesterday while waiting for my son to take his final pre-calc exam.</p>
<p>My worship leader at my church often needs to create little arrangements for psalms, which are sung as part of the liturgy. She previously had a process of going to the USCCB website, copying and pasting the psalm for a weekend into a Word document, formatting it, adding chords for it, and then exporting it to PDF, finally uploading it to Planning Center Online, our database for all things planning around our liturgies.</p>
<p>I showed her that PCO lets you create <a href="https://pcoservices.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013738628-Lyrics-Chords-Editor">Lyrics and Chords</a> for any arrangement, cutting out all the work of formatting in Word, but still required you to go to the USCCB site, find the date, and then copy/format the results.</p>
<p>Enter the <a href="https://astrodad.github.io/psalmist.html">USCCB Psalm Extractor</a>!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very basic tool (ugly code that definitely needs to be optimized) that parses the USCCB site for a particular date and then extracts a cleanly formatted version of the psalm for easy copy and pasting into the PCO Lyrics and Chords editor.</p>
<p>What I learned making this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trying to use ChatGPT as a coding assistant is terrible but helpful to get an idea off the ground</li>
<li>I like the debugging tools inside Safari more than Chrome at this point</li>
<li>The USCCB has a stranglehold on the text and makes it impossible to access the readings without an API, and because the format of the DOM is not consistent from day to day. Someone needs to break this monopoly.</li>
<li>CORS proxy servers exist</li>
<li>I am not a professional coder any longer and I need to brush up big time!</li>
</ul>
<p>I will make a few more enhancements to this, but feel free to use it, knowing it could go away at any moment of break if I mess something up.</p>

			 <p>There’s more to the Pope’s “white flag” comment than meets the eye.</p>
<p><a href="https://wherepeteris.com/the-popes-war-on-war/">The Pope&rsquo;s War on War - Where Peter Is</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many are wondering why Pope Francis has been unwilling to speak out boldly in favor of Ukraine in their struggle against Russian invaders. The answer to this question is likely counterintuitive to most of us. Many will surely find it foolish. It is, however, integral to Pope Francis’s worldview. To put it simply: Pope Francis prioritizes nonviolence over war as a matter of principle. From the beginning of his papacy, Francis has been consistent about the inviolability and dignity of the human person, and this principle applies to his frequent calls for fighting around the world to cease.</p>

			 <p>I was pleasantly surprised at the level of detail in this article I found about why I need to cut down the extra tape every time I print a label. It&rsquo;s an annoying thing to deal with when you are labeling sound equipment to always need a scissor even when there is a tape cutter on the actual printer. The article even explains why it&rsquo;s necessary:</p>

			 <p>This week was a bit less busy than last, which was good because there was a little time to rest. Some of this week&rsquo;s highlights included getting a chance to see the the Messiah Men’s volleyball team play nearby, running livestream/recording for a presentation on the Shroud of Turin for a school where my wife works, and a very happy dinner with friends celebrating a leap year baby at the Royal Taj (yes, the same one we went to last week!).</p>

<p>The presentation on the Shroud of Turin was interesting. I was mostly there just to teach my Worship Tech students on how a livestream works, and the basics of operating switching and cameras, but it was still informative. I don’t know quote where I stand on its authenticity, but I can see why people believe in it.</p>

<p><em>My ID.4 parked in Mount Vernon while I wait for Alex at German school.</em></p>
<p>I really do love this car. More accurately, I have a love-hate relationship with it. It drives amazing. I save a ton of money on gas (I will never go back to dino -juice if I can avoid it). But VW tried too hard to make it &ldquo;smart&rdquo; and it falls short in many areas where they over-engineered (Germans never do that).</p>

<p>As a Christian, I find the conflation of Christianity of nationalism concerning. Too many out there are intentionally mixing the two in an attempt to seize power and assert their own will over the rights of others. This reminds me of the &ldquo;family values&rdquo; of the KKK in the 20&rsquo;s.</p>

		<a href="https://plumey.com/2024/03/04/meg-hunterkilmers-bible.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-03-04 22:07:34 -0400">Mar 4, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I recently started, and then failed to finish, the Bible-in-year reading plan by <a href="https://www.piercedhands.com/reading-bible-year/" title="Meg Hunter-Kilmer">Meg Hunter-Kilmer</a>. So I decided to make a Reading Plan inside the awesome Logos/Verbum app. Here&rsquo;s what I did:</p>
<ol>
<li>I converted the Kindle version of the book I bought to PDF and then extracted out the pages with the reading plan. The plan is actually available for free on the page linked above, but the book is done in a Journal Style which is nice, and I already bought it. It also had an easier time exporting in the following steps.</li>
<li>I exported the pages as a spreadsheet inside Adobe Acrobat</li>
<li>I cleaned up the output into three columns and then, one-by-one, I copied the column to the clipboard and then pasted them inside separate Passage Lists inside Verbum. This took a little time, as there were sometimes missing entries (didn&rsquo;t total up to 365). In those cases, there&rsquo;s an option inside of the Passage List to export, and choose a Copy to Clipboard option. Pasting that in the column next to my original list showed why some of the passages weren&rsquo;t found. In some cases the chapter numbers had been incorrectly changed to a letter, and in others, like the book of Daniel, some of the verses were not in the version of the text I had selected in the Passage List. It was easy enough to add those manually in the Passage List.</li>
<li>I created a Custom Reading Plan and added each of the three Passsage Lists above using the option in the menu to add a Passage List.</li>
</ol>
<p>This all worked surprisingly well and I now have a synced reading plan on all my devices with reminders to read every day!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to use this in the Verbum app, you can <a href="https://flshare.net/g67pd4">access the document here</a>.</p>

<p>We were all exhausted by the travel to SC for my father&rsquo;s funeral and so I sort of zombied my way through the week.</p>
<p>I spent a good amount of time working on the sound system installation at St. Augustine. We are trying to wrap that whole effort up and move towards the video phase, but there are still a ton of details that need to be sorted out like training, integration into the worship teams, documentation, and then smaller add-ons like ambiance and choir microphones.</p>
<p>On Friday my oldest came to town to deal with a traffic citation and it was his first time in a court room. I hope he was &ldquo;scared straight&rdquo; and will slow the heck down.</p>
<p>The dog needed another round of laser treatment after her CCL tear a couple of months ago. She seems to improve every day, although given how hard her life is, I&rsquo;m surprised she hasn&rsquo;t bounced back quicker.</p>

<p>We spent a lovely morning up in Baltimore while the youngest was in German class. We had a nice breakfast at a place called Dooby&rsquo;s</p>

</a>

</p>
<p>And then we found a nice plant shop in Mount Vernon where we talked with the owner about football (the other kind) and about his shop. It&rsquo;s always great to meet the owner of a small business.</p>

</a>

</p>
<p>We then took the oldest and his girlfriend to dinner to celebrate my youngest&rsquo;s Confirmation, which happened today. We took them to our favorite Indian place in town to much enjoyment, but a major hit to the wallet.</p>
<p>The actual Confirmation Mass was lovely. We had a stand-in Bishop since the one scheduled had a family emergency. The music was great (they were my friends) and everything went mostly well. My youngest also read a passage and did a great job.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>TV</strong>: I got to watch a couple episodes of the new Bad Batch season. It&rsquo;s a great show and I&rsquo;m very excited about how they will wrap this up and how it weaves into the narrative of the sequels.</li>
<li><strong>Gaming</strong>: nothing new on this front as I really didn&rsquo;t have any time to play</li>
<li><strong>Web</strong>: This week I&rsquo;ve done a fair bit of reading on various audio stuff related to my system integration project. I had to learn some new equalization techniques. I&rsquo;ll post some of this later.</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t gather links, but I&rsquo;m planning on starting to do that this week.  Here are a few things I remember looking into:</p>

			 <p>Agility (what used to be Version One) is quite possibly the web app that I hate using the most. It has a ridiculous amount of wasted space on-screen and the description editor is so unintuitive that I edit somewhere else and copy/paste into the app. Unfortunately, my team is required to use it. Anyone have any good hacks to make this terrible product more usable?</p>

			 <p>Created a Check-In Shortcut that allows me to search for a venue, select it from a list, add a note, select a category, and then optionally upload a photo, and then post that info to a secondary (currently hidden) micro.blog blog. This blog has a customized theme optimized (sort of) for these check-ins. I&rsquo;m still figuring out how I want to expose this to my friends. But the shortcut works really well and now I don&rsquo;t have to rely on OwnYourSwarm to do this for me. The only thing missing right now is that there&rsquo;s no link back to a website about the venue. I am going to clean up the shortcut and offer it up to share once I figure out how to do that 😆.</p>

			 <p>★★★☆☆ Snow Crash by Neil Stephenson  </p>
<p>I really wanted to love Neil Stephenson’s <em>Snow Crash</em>. It has all the makings of a great tale: archaeolgy, vintage but also not-vintage tech, cyberspace, katanas, and the mafia. </p>
<p><strong>Minor Spoilers below 👇</strong></p>
<p>What I liked:</p>
<p>- Stephenson’s prose is easy to follow and carries the story well<br />- theoretical and (highly) outlandish relationship established between ancient religions and information warfare<br />- visionary scope of what a metaverse could be (he coined the phrase, I believe)<br />- satirical perspective of unmitigated capitalism</p>
<p>What I disliked:</p>
<p>- Absurdity of the plot, it was just too much and his long expositions with the non-sentient Librarian and his chief allies were identical. If you have to spend literally ten pages of the main character talking through the plot, I think you’ve gone too far.<br />- Paper-thin characters. They had promise but other than one character calling her mom and another finally getting to be with a girl, no character had a single step of movement.<br />- Sexual exploitation of a minor (yes)<br /><br />Overall, I’m glad I read it, as it has been on my list for a while, but in the end, I didn’t find it very memorable. </p>

			 <p>Apple Fitness to the Rescue</p>
<p>I don’t know what I did (except to continue along the inexorable march towards death), but today I’ve had some severe pain in my hips and lower back. It didn’t help that I attempted to walk up a flight of stairs in a historic district in my home while also trying to carry a 15lb bag of dog food.</p>
<p>So to try and alleviate some of the discomfort, I turned to some trusty Apple Fitness+ workouts that I’ve done over the past few months. I didn’t realize until today that I could search their site and so I found these when I was looking for a few good stretches:</p>

<p>I found some nice stretches in one of the Yoga workouts with Jessica and they really helped. That and a warm compress and some ibuprofen.</p>

<li>The audio and visuals engrossed me. I feel like they really nailed the aesthetic of the time. The use of black and white was interesting, and the soundtrack was very immersive.</li>
<li>Acting was quite good. I especially enjoyed the performances of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0614165/?ref_=tt_cl_t_1">Cillian Murphy</a>,  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1289434/?ref_=tt_cl_t_2">Emily Blunt</a>. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000354/?ref_=tt_cl_t_3">Matt Damon</a>, and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000375/?ref_=tt_cl_t_4">Robert Downey Jr</a>.  I was really surprised by the number of recognizable stars including<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0342241/?ref_=tt_cl_i_6"> Sean Grimes</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000110/?ref_=tt_cl_i_13">Kenneth Branagh</a>, and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001282/?ref_=tt_cl_t_9">Tony Goldwyn</a>.</li>
<li>I only had a minimum understanding of the history of Dr. Oppenheimer, and this movie has renewed my interest in not only in his story, but also that of the development of these incredible weapons. The movie did a good job at introducing us to the geopolitical issues surrounding the development of the weapon and also the growth of the nuclear arsenal.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not a scientist, but I appreciated the movie&rsquo;s portrayal of the scientists involved with this effort as refreshing, highlighting their struggle of the theory vs the pragmatic implications of their work.</li>
<li>The movie did a good job balancing the perspectives of the immense power of these weapons, and also the need for such weapons in the modern world. Those that are responsible for the oversight of the weapons in the arsenals of today&rsquo;s nuclear powers could always use a reminder of the gravity of the responsibility that they bear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it was an enjoyable experience, enhanced by the knowledge that my oldest son still wants to spend time with his old man. I&rsquo;m going to be diving into a little more history, so if you have a recommendation on further reading, please let me know!</p>

Stuart <a href="http://www.strudel.org.uk/blog/astro/001032.shtml" target="_blank">chronicles</a> why he wrote the search engine (spoiler: government shutdown) and goes a bit into some of the technical work to make it happen. He&rsquo;s also the man behind this excellent <a href="http://lcogt.net/virtualsky" title="Virtual Sky HTML5 Planetarium" target="_blank">Virtual Sky HTML5 Planetarium</a>. If you&rsquo;re an astronomy nerd, Stuarts&rsquo;s web site ought to get your heart rate going.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently in the tail end of a writing project and I&rsquo;ve used the APOD search to get photo inspiration, descriptive support of astronomical objects in my story, and sadly, to procrastinate while dealing with writer&rsquo;s block. It&rsquo;s a great tool. Go check it out.</p>

			 <p><em>** Update 2013-10-25 to include nValt</em></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve spent months and months developing the backstory, characters, and places for your story. You&rsquo;ve obsessed over every detail. For instance you know that your main character loves pizza with anchovies but only on Tuesday and only when he&rsquo;s eating at home. You&rsquo;ve designed a planet where the terraforming process has left the swamps smelling like flatulence and the natives looking like glow-in-the-dark bobble heads.</p>
<p>But now that you&rsquo;re deep in your writing you need to remember those details so that you don&rsquo;t send your hero running in the nausea-inducing forest of your terraformed planet without a gas mask. Where do you look? How are you storing this massive Tolkien-ish universe you&rsquo;ve built? Should you? Yes! Documenting your created universe so that you always have a place to reference your characters and settings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the middle of writing a science fiction story for kids and I&rsquo;m struggling with the same question.  Here are my list of requirements:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>I need a way to create relationships between items.</strong> If a character lives on a terraformed planet I should be able to link the character to the planet bidirectionally and list all of the characters of importance that also live on that planet.</li>
	<li> <strong>I need a way to search across all items.</strong> This is a no-brainer. I remember vaguely that one of my characters had an obsession with peanut butter. But which one?</li>
	<li><strong>I need to update my universe at any time no matter where I am.</strong> Like many of us, I'm on the go quite a bit. So access to from my iPad, browser, and even in some offline capacity would be very useful.</li>
	<li><strong>I need to eventually share my universe with a publisher/agent and with the public.</strong> Why would I want to expose my universe to the outside world? Because I eventually want to get published. Any tool that conveys the depth of my story will help me to get published (so I hope). Plus, I would love to eventually let fans explore the universe on their own and maybe even contribute to it based on what they've read in the book(s).</li>
	<li><strong>I need to display images, video, and audio.</strong> I document my universe using diagrams, photos, video clips, and even audio clippings (mostly from my commute to work). These content types should all be viewable within the library.</li>
	<li><strong>I need to reference the library no matter where I am.</strong> This is the one requirement that is seemingly at odds with #3 and #4 above. I might need access while on a plane or while sitting at my son's basketball practice where there's no signal.</li>

<h1>Option #1 - Build an actual Wiki</h1>
Wikis have been around for a long time. They're easy to edit and many of the newer wiki types let you embed video and audio. Creating links between documents is easy. Users can edit wikis themselves and you can even mark some hosted wikis as private if the wiki provider offers that feature. The problem with most wikis is that there is no offline access to them with the option to synch up changes you've made while offline. I looked at <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/" target="_blank">Flying Meat's VoodooPad</a>  and it comes close. It offers a Web Export option that creates static HTML pages for your entire wiki. They even offer an iOS client that lets you edit files on the go if you use Dropbox to store your VooDooPad file. The software costs $40 but they do offer a free trial. I'm currently evaluating this solution. My main question as of now is whether or not you can sync the entire wiki offline on the iOS client for viewing offline.
<h1>Option #2 - Evernote</h1>
If you're into information management you've already heard of Evernote. It's the uber note taking and digital collection platform that runs on the web, desktop, and mobile devices. I created an Evernote notebook and created notes for various characters. Then I linked them together by creating an index note with links to the individual notes. The process is cumbersome. Dragging and dropping on the desktop is easy, but editing the links between notes on their mobile devices is difficult. I did find some handy AppleScript code to automate this but it didn't work well and resulted in even more work for me.
<p>Evernote will let you share your notebooks to individuals or to the entire web using a Public Link. <a href="https://www.evernote.com/pub/jplumey/testuniversenotebook" target="_blank">Here&rsquo;s an example of this</a>. Notice the lack of any real organization, sorting, and hierarchy. If you have a Premium account you can sync the notes and notebooks offline to your devices. Sharing the notebook to the world is easy, but editing requires an Evernote account and explicitly granting permissions to the editor. This might be fine if you&rsquo;re working with an agent/publisher/editor but not ideal for the public.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re already using Evernote to keep track of your universe while you&rsquo;re writing, this option might be a natural progression.</p>
<p>So these are just two options that I&rsquo;m currently playing with. Are you a writer? Do you have similar requirements? What do you do? Please let me know in the comments.</p>
<h1> Option #3 - nValt</h1>
<a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nValt</a> is a simple yet powerful note-taking software that allows you to create simple text notes using your keyboard. I like it because you can very quickly create new documents that link to each other. Just start typing a title, hit Enter and you have a text file. Once in you're in your text file, put something in brackets like this: [[Characters]], and nValt turns that into a link. Click the link, hit Enter, and you have your Characters document. No, it doesn't export easily and it doesn't support images or videos, but it has the option to save each note as a file which you can sync with Dropbox and thus edit on any device you want. I wish I could create notes and links this easily in Evernote. If you don't need images or video or any kind of rich text (although nValt does support Markdown), this might be a lightning-fast way to get your universe documented.
