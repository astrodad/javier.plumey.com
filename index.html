		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>üçø Just had a chance to watch the new Oppenheimer #movie from Christopher Nolan. My oldest son (20) wanted to go see it, and even though I had seen the trailers, it wasn&rsquo;t previously on my must-see list. At a little over three hours long, I wasn&rsquo;t really sure the material would grip me long enough to sit through it.</p>
<p>Wow, was I wrong!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the eloquence to give it a real &ldquo;review&rdquo;, so I&rsquo;ll just drop a few nuggets of impressions here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The audio and visuals engrossed me. I feel like they really nailed the aesthetic of the time. The use of black and white was interesting, and the soundtrack was very immersive.</li>
<li>Acting was quite good. I especially enjoyed the performances of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0614165/?ref_=tt_cl_t_1">Cillian Murphy</a>,  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1289434/?ref_=tt_cl_t_2">Emily Blunt</a>. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000354/?ref_=tt_cl_t_3">Matt Damon</a>, and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000375/?ref_=tt_cl_t_4">Robert Downey Jr</a>.  I was really surprised by the number of recognizable stars including<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0342241/?ref_=tt_cl_i_6"> Sean Grimes</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000110/?ref_=tt_cl_i_13">Kenneth Branagh</a>, and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001282/?ref_=tt_cl_t_9">Tony Goldwyn</a>.</li>
<li>I only had a minimum understanding of the history of Dr. Oppenheimer, and this movie has renewed my interest in not only in his story, but also that of the development of these incredible weapons. The movie did a good job at introducing us to the geopolitical issues surrounding the development of the weapon and also the growth of the nuclear arsenal.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not a scientist, but I appreciated the movie&rsquo;s portrayal of the scientists involved with this effort as refreshing, highlighting their struggle of the theory vs the pragmatic implications of their work.</li>
<li>The movie did a good job balancing the perspectives of the immense power of these weapons, and also the need for such weapons in the modern world. Those that are responsible for the oversight of the weapons in the arsenals of today&rsquo;s nuclear powers could always use a reminder of the gravity of the responsibility that they bear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it was an enjoyable experience, enhanced by the knowledge that my oldest son still wants to spend time with his old man. I&rsquo;m going to be diving into a little more history, so if you have a recommendation on further reading, please let me know!</p>

			 <p>üí≠ The problem with taking showers (for me), is that I walk out bursting with ideas. Is it because there are no distractions, the white noise of the water? I regularly have to add several things to my to-do list after a shower. Is it just me?</p>

			 <p>üìñ I&rsquo;ve not read alot of mystery books, but I just completed The Murder at the Vicarage by Agatha Christie. I love the period and it has so many moving parts. I don&rsquo;t read alot of myster books, but I loved this one, and I&rsquo;m a sucker for the writing of the period. Any reccs?</p>

			 <p>Played a bit of scrabble with the little one. Our modified rules said you could use acronyms. Let me tell you, there is an acronym for EVERYTHING.  And yes, this is a very old Scrabble board. My family and I used to play together, and apparently my sister loved to doodle all over the box. I now know that she loved Duran Duran and that she rocks, evidently.</p>

			 <p>This is the quintissential &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; for the blogsphere. As much as I write on a regular basis for my work at Numinous.FM, my career work as a technical consultant, and my novels, I haven&rsquo;t regularly posted a blog. I hope to change that going forward, as well as start contributing to the IndieWeb culture. I&rsquo;m moving over from a Wordpress Blog, so things are a bit sparse here, but in time I hope to add more content.</p>

			 <p>I just discovered this fantastic search engine for the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day library. It&rsquo;s written by Stuart who runs the @apod twitter account and blogs at <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.strudel.org.uk/blog/astro/">http://www.strudel.org.uk/blog/astro/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Stuart <!-- raw HTML omitted -->chronicles<!-- raw HTML omitted --> why he wrote the search engine (spoiler: government shutdown) and goes a bit into some of the technical work to make it happen. He&rsquo;s also the man behind this excellent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Virtual Sky HTML5 Planetarium<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If you&rsquo;re an astronomy nerd, Stuarts&rsquo;s web site ought to get your heart rate going.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently in the tail end of a writing project and I&rsquo;ve used the APOD search to get photo inspiration, descriptive support of astronomical objects in my story, and sadly, to procrastinate while dealing with writer&rsquo;s block. It&rsquo;s a great tool. Go check it out.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve spent months and months developing the backstory, characters, and places for your story. You&rsquo;ve obsessed over every detail. For instance you know that your main character loves pizza with anchovies but only on Tuesday and only when he&rsquo;s eating at home. You&rsquo;ve designed a planet where the terraforming process has left the swamps smelling like flatulence and the natives looking like glow-in-the-dark bobble heads.</p>
<p>But now that you&rsquo;re deep in your writing you need to remember those details so that you don&rsquo;t send your hero running in the nausea-inducing forest of your terraformed planet without a gas mask. Where do you look? How are you storing this massive Tolkien-ish universe you&rsquo;ve built? Should you? Yes! Documenting your created universe so that you always have a place to reference your characters and settings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the middle of writing a science fiction story for kids and I&rsquo;m struggling with the same question. ¬†Here are my list of requirements:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Evernote will let you share your notebooks to individuals or to the entire web using a Public Link. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here&rsquo;s an example of this<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Notice the lack of any real organization, sorting, and hierarchy. If you have a Premium account you can sync the notes and notebooks offline to your devices. Sharing the notebook to the world is easy, but editing requires an Evernote account and explicitly granting permissions to the editor. This might be fine if you&rsquo;re working with an agent/publisher/editor but not ideal for the public.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re already using Evernote to keep track of your universe while you&rsquo;re writing, this option might be a natural progression.</p>
<p>So these are just two options that I&rsquo;m currently playing with. Are you a writer? Do you have similar requirements? What do you do? Please let me know in the comments.</p>
