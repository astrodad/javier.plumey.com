Some of this week's highlights included getting a chance to see the the Messiah Men’s volleyball team play nearby, running livestream/recording for a presentation on the Shroud of Turin for a school where my wife works, and a very happy dinner with friends celebrating a leap year baby at the Royal Taj (yes, the same one we went to last week!).\n\n![A volley team huddles with their arms raised and hands joined in a show of unity on the court, with spectators in the background. The players are wearing matching navy blue uniforms.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/27737/2024/29a4e750-0c74-42ed-ab3f-51ff91d91747.jpg)\n\n*The men’s team won in 5 sets. Good match, probably a little closer than it should have been.*\n\nMy son is one of the short ones in the huddle.\n\n![A computer monitor displaying a video streaming interface, with a preview of an elderly man speaking and a script on the right side. In the foreground, a computer keyboard, a mouse, a microphone with a blue foam cover, and cables are visible. ](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/27737/2024/2b4c4dbb-b502-44a9-bb73-3034967db280.jpg)\n\nThe presentation on the Shroud of Turin was interesting. I was mostly there just to teach my Worship Tech students on how a livestream works, and the basics of operating switching and cameras, but it was still informative. I don’t know quote where I stand on its authenticity, but I can see why people believe in it.\n\n![Traffic moving through an illuminated tunnel with blurred motion.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/27737/2024/55e15781-4e71-4180-bfcc-615384637b94.jpg)\n\n*Another day, another drive through the tunnel.*\n\n![A gray VW ID.4 parked on a city street in front of a building with a \"Active Physical Therapy\" sign displaying services for auto injury, work injury, and sports injury.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/27737/2024/518145fa-83fb-4334-82cb-7f9de2e53c8b.jpg)\n\n*My ID.4 parked in Mount Vernon while I wait for Alex at German school.*\n\nI really do love this car. More accurately, I have a love-hate relationship with it. It drives amazing. I save a ton of money on gas (I will never go back to dino -juice if I can avoid it). But VW tried too hard to make it \"smart\" and it falls short in many areas where they over-engineered (Germans never do that).\n\n![A bottle of Ecco Domani wine from 2022 in a silver ice bucket, with glasses of red wine and a blurred background of a cozy dining setting.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/27737/2024/6e8d9497-5bdf-42d5-b025-b43760dbd545.jpg)\n\n## Media\n\n- **TV**: I didn't watch ANY TV this week!\n- **Gaming**: No games, again!\n- **Movies**: I was able to sit and over the span of a couple of days watch [https://plumey.com/2024/03/10/dune-part-i.html](Dune, Part 1).\n\n ## Links\n\nI've started to use a self-hosted instance of Linkding to gather links. So far I am liking it, and it has an API which will let me create a shortcut to extract recent links and put them into markdown for easy insertion into this weekly column. I will see how it works next week! \n",

It has all the makings of a great tale: archaeolgy, vintage but also not-vintage tech, cyberspace, katanas, and the mafia. </p>\n<p><strong>Minor Spoilers below 👇</strong></p>\n<p>What I liked:</p>\n<p>- Stephenson’s prose is easy to follow and carries the story well<br />- theoretical and (highly) outlandish relationship established between ancient religions and information warfare<br />- visionary scope of what a metaverse could be (he coined the phrase, I believe)<br />- satirical perspective of unmitigated capitalism</p>\n<p>What I disliked:</p>\n<p>- Absurdity of the plot, it was just too much and his long expositions with the non-sentient Librarian and his chief allies were identical. If you have to spend literally ten pages of the main character talking through the plot, I think you’ve gone too far.<br />- Paper-thin characters. They had promise but other than one character calling her mom and another finally getting to be with a girl, no character had a single step of movement.<br />- Sexual exploitation of a minor (yes)<br /><br />Overall, I’m glad I read it, as it has been on my list for a while, but in the end, I didn’t find it very memorable. </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<em>** Update 2013-10-25 to include nValt</em>\n\nYou've spent months and months developing the backstory, characters, and places for your story. You've obsessed over every detail. For instance you know that your main character loves pizza with anchovies but only on Tuesday and only when he's eating at home. You've designed a planet where the terraforming process has left the swamps smelling like flatulence and the natives looking like glow-in-the-dark bobble heads.\n\nBut now that you're deep in your writing you need to remember those details so that you don't send your hero running in the nausea-inducing forest of your terraformed planet without a gas mask. Where do you look? How are you storing this massive Tolkien-ish universe you've built? Should you? Yes! Documenting your created universe so that you always have a place to reference your characters and settings.\n\nI'm in the middle of writing a science fiction story for kids and I'm struggling with the same question.  Here are my list of requirements:\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>I need a way to create relationships between items.</strong> If a character lives on a terraformed planet I should be able to link the character to the planet bidirectionally and list all of the characters of importance that also live on that planet.</li>\n\t<li> <strong>I need a way to search across all items.</strong> This is a no-brainer. I remember vaguely that one of my characters had an obsession with peanut butter. But which one?</li>\n\t<li><strong>I need to update my universe at any time no matter where I am.</strong> Like many of us, I'm on the go quite a bit. So access to from my iPad, browser, and even in some offline capacity would be very useful.</li>\n\t<li><strong>I need to eventually share my universe with a publisher/agent and with the public.</strong> Why would I want to expose my universe to the outside world? Because I eventually want to get published. Any tool that conveys the depth of my story will help me to get published (so I hope). Plus, I would love to eventually let fans explore the universe on their own and maybe even contribute to it based on what they've read in the book(s).</li>\n\t<li><strong>I need to display images, video, and audio.</strong> I document my universe using diagrams, photos, video clips, and even audio clippings (mostly from my commute to work). These content types should all be viewable within the library.</li>\n\t<li><strong>I need to reference the library no matter where I am.</strong> This is the one requirement that is seemingly at odds with #3 and #4 above. I might need access while on a plane or while sitting at my son's basketball practice where there's no signal.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Option #1 - Build an actual Wiki</h1>\nWikis have been around for a long time. They're easy to edit and many of the newer wiki types let you embed video and audio. Creating links between documents is easy. Users can edit wikis themselves and you can even mark some hosted wikis as private if the wiki provider offers that feature. The problem with most wikis is that there is no offline access to them with the option to synch up changes you've made while offline. I looked at <a href=\"http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/\" target=\"_blank\">Flying Meat's VoodooPad</a>  and it comes close. It offers a Web Export option that creates static HTML pages for your entire wiki. They even offer an iOS client that lets you edit files on the go if you use Dropbox to store your VooDooPad file. The software costs $40 but they do offer a free trial. I'm currently evaluating this solution. My main question as of now is whether or not you can sync the entire wiki offline on the iOS client for viewing offline.\n<h1>Option #2 - Evernote</h1>\nIf you're into information management you've already heard of Evernote. It's the uber note taking and digital collection platform that runs on the web, desktop, and mobile devices. I created an Evernote notebook and created notes for various characters. Then I linked them together by creating an index note with links to the individual notes. The process is cumbersome. Dragging and dropping on the desktop is easy, but editing the links between notes on their mobile devices is difficult. I did find some handy AppleScript code to automate this but it didn't work well and resulted in even more work for me.\n\nEvernote will let you share your notebooks to individuals or to the entire web using a Public Link. <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/pub/jplumey/testuniversenotebook\" target=\"_blank\">Here's an example of this</a>. Notice the lack of any real organization, sorting, and hierarchy. If you have a Premium account you can sync the notes and notebooks offline to your devices. Sharing the notebook to the world is easy, but editing requires an Evernote account and explicitly granting permissions to the editor. This might be fine if you're working with an agent/publisher/editor but not ideal for the public.\n\nIf you're already using Evernote to keep track of your universe while you're writing, this option might be a natural progression.\n\nSo these are just two options that I'm currently playing with. Are you a writer? Do you have similar requirements? What do you do? Please let me know in the comments.\n<h1> Option #3 - nValt</h1>\n<a href=\"http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/\">nValt</a> is a simple yet powerful note-taking software that allows you to create simple text notes using your keyboard. I like it because you can very quickly create new documents that link to each other. Just start typing a title, hit Enter and you have a text file. Once in you're in your text file, put something in brackets like this: [[Characters]], and nValt turns that into a link. Click the link, hit Enter, and you have your Characters document. No, it doesn't export easily and it doesn't support images or videos, but it has the option to save each note as a file which you can sync with Dropbox and thus edit on any device you want. I wish I could create notes and links this easily in Evernote. If you don't need images or video or any kind of rich text (although nValt does support Markdown), this might be a lightning-fast way to get your universe documented.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n",
